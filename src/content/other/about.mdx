What's up, it's Kaiman!

I am a crocodile-grey wolf on the internet, and sometimes I yap in front of a camera. Other times I scream in front of a computer screen. Sometimes, I even drop a note or two. But today, I am typing on a keyboard writing to you guys!

If you want to know a bit about me, to be more clear, I create content online, am an avid video gamer, and create music and do some programming if I can. I am a proud Southern United States enjoyer (I love soul food) and my alma mater is the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, with a focus in Intelligence and Media (go Jackets!)

For those that are curious, my current setup for my various activities are as follows:
* Operating System: Windows 10/11 and Fedora Linux dual boot
* IDE: Zed
* DAW: Ableton Live Suite 12
(and more to add as needed!)

I will probably add more as time progresses, but this should be it for now. Enjoy my little slice of life on the internet because enshittification never sucked so hard!
