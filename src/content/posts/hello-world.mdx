Hello, everyone!

After several days, weeks... months... of wanting to do this, I finally have a website up! The key now is to maintain it and update it, haha.

There are still some additions I want to make, including adding an Art channel, some backend improvements, and maybe more stylistic changes. But for now, this will do. I hope you guys stick around!
